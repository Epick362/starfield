This is an experiment I've done while playing with, er..., I mean, learning about
the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) library. [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) is a lightweight javascript 3D engine written by [Mr.Doob](http://mrdoob.com/) & others. Be sure to check it out, it's pretty awesome stuff :).
